## Development üöÄ

-   **useState**: Manage state variables for dynamic updates and user input.

-   **useRef**:- 
	- useRef is a hook that returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). 
	 - The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. 
	 - Simply, kisi bhi value ko persist karne ke liye useRef hook ka use karte hain.

-   **useEffect**: Handle side effects like updating the password on user input changes.
	- useEffect is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components.
	 - Whatever is inside this function will be called when the component mounts and when the dependencies changes.
	- Basic Syntax - useEffect(() => {*//write the function body here*}, [*//here the dependencies goes*])

-   **useCallback**: 
	- useCallback is a hook that returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.
	- Dependency array - whatever values is interlinked with each other, we put them in the dependency array.
	- Syntax - useCallback(() => {//write the function body here}, [//here the dependencies goes])
